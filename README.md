## What is this?

This tool will assist you to quickly roll up a treasure drop, be it from a regular individual encounter or from a treasure hoard. 

This webapp generates treasure as described in the Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition Dungeon Masters Guide. So no more need for endless rolling on tables, just a quick press on a button and you are set!

## How does this work?

It's very easy. In the options panel you must choose between an individual roll or a treasure hoard and adjust the slider to match the Challange Rating of the monster, then choose whatever extra treasure you want your roll to include.
